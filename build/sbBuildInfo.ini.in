# Why is there no RepoRevisionClient, you ask? We have to treat client-pull
# revisions slightly differently, because we modify the repo itself whenever
# we do a build (bookend-build.py). The svn revision given below is done via
# keyword substitution, so in the common case (svn up to HEAD, in the daily
# case), it should be correct.
# BUT, it's provided merely as a convenience; the build system/buildbots rely on
# master-build-info.txt, which is sitting in the root of this repository...
# and if you want to be 100% sure/correct, so should you..
