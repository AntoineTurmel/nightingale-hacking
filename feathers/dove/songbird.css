= Songbird CSS Architecture =
Songbird's CSS is made to make feathering easier.  At the top level, we make a distinction between styles 
for the Main Player, the Mini Player, and the Dialog Boxes. From there we split up styles into 3 cascading 
layers: Size & Position, Color and Imagery. I've also excerpted out the "-moz-appearance: none" style into 
a base style sheet so our potential featherers wouldn't have to worry about the default -moz styles 
affecting their work as it did ours.  

== Size & Position ==
Move it around, test it out, move it around. These style sheets include margins, padding, -moz-styles, 
size, alignment, etc. If it's not a color or an image or "-moz-appearance: none", it belongs in the 
Size & Position style sheet. For the Main Window, this is mainwin.css, for the mini this is mini.css, 
and for everything else, dialog.css.

== Color ==
Everything that can be colored in Songbird is colored in one stylesheet. If you want to customize your 
Songbird with a new paint scheme: see mainwin_colors.css for the Main window, see mini_colors.css for 
the Mini Player, and dialog_colors.css for everything else.

== Images ==
All images used in rendering Songbird can be found in one stylesheet. For the Main window, this is 
mainwin_images.css. Dialogs have only 2 images for check boxes so we've left those in dialog_color.css 
and saved making another css file for dialogs. If you'd like to make one, be sure to add it to this stylesheet
in the Cascade section and add it to the appropriate jar file.  In this case, it's jar.mn.in found in
the same folder as this style sheet.

== Songbird's 8 stylesheets ==
1. Songbird.css - This style sheet @imports the other stylesheets.

2. base_styles.css

3. mainwin.css

4. mainwin_colors.css

5. mainwin_images.css

6. dialog.css

7. dialog_colors.css

8. mini.css
