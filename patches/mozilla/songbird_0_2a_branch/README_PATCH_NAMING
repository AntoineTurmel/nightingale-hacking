Patches in this dir get applied to the Mozilla XULRunner build by tools/scripts/common/apply-patches.sh. It applies only the patches that start with 'bug'. 

Which means if you are committing a script that MUST be applied for Songbird to work with XULRunner then you must name it starting with 'bug', preferably follwed by the bug number in the mozilla bugzilla database.

If the patch is only a convenience patch or something to be applied only when extra functionality is needed DO NOT start the patchname with 'bug'.

You have been warned.
