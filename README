Nightingale is a community based fork of the Songbird Web/Media player
distributed under the GNU GPL and portions (xulrunner and mozilla libs)
licensed under the Mozilla MPL/BSD license. 

The goal of Nightingale is to create a Linux only player, which will 
eventually use only system libraries to conserve space. Currently, some
libraries are still bundled, but progress is being made to change this 
fact.

This git tree is the old 1.8 tree for Nightingale, kept here for backup
and also maintained to build until 1.10 is ready. Please report problems
in the forums

========================================================================
Notes:
========================================================================

*To build, you need to have all of the gstreamer0.10 packages for your 
distro, svn, wget, and git (if pulling the tree down) installed, 
as well as the usual dependencies for building software upon your 
distro.

*If it gets python errors, make sure you have python2 installed,
and try the build.sh script again.

*If it doesn't play music, you'll need to copy /usr/lib/gstreamer0.10/*
into compiled-dist-linux-[your arch]/dist/gst-plugins and then 
rerun nightingale. It should then play music.

========================================================================
Building:
========================================================================
If on Linux, simply run the build.sh script. It will download the deps
and build the app for you. 

Ubuntu users should note you'll need:
libdbus-glib-1-dev
libgstreamer-plugins-base0.10-dev

If on Mac or Windows, don't use build.sh, 
instead follow the instructions on the Songbird wiki (you'd be better 
off running Songbird builds for now anyway, if on Mac or Windows).
