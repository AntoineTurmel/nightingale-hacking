Nightingale is a community based fork of the Songbird Web/Media player
distributed under the GNU GPL and portions (xulrunner and mozilla libs)
licensed under the Mozilla MPL/BSD license. 

The goal of Nightingale is to create a Linux only player, which will 
eventually use only system libraries to conserve space. Currently, some
libraries are still bundled, but progress is being made to change this 
fact.

This git tree is the upstream/future version of Nightingale, slated
to use xulrunner 6.0.2+ and other current libraries. Hopefully, it's
first release will be without the libraries bundled within, so that
it can use system libs.
