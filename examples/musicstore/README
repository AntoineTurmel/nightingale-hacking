This is a sample music store implemented using the Songbird web page api.

Simply place the files on a web server and browse to the directory with Songbird.

musicstore.js contains some convenience methods to facilitate access to the web page api. 
albums.js represents track meta data that would be normally coming from a database backend.

It also demonstrates integration with OpenSearch to add a custom search box in Songbird. 
Edit the search.xml file to provide full url for your search location.
